## Acknowledgments
A huge thank you to Marjolaine Matabos, Benthic ecologist at the Laboratoire Environnement Profond (PDG-REM-EEP-LEP - https://annuaire.ifremer.fr/cv/20350/en/) for very spontaneously sharing annotated examples of various species, as well as research papers providing more context on the project.
